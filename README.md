This is a automation demo project where the functionalities of the homepage("test_HomePage.py" of the website are tested.
Additionally, an end-to-end test is conducted (test_e2e.py), starting from the moment the web page is opened, selecting an item from the e-commerce website,
and proceeding to the checkout page to complete the purchase.(go to the "tests" folder to review the code)

The code has been Pushed to GitHub using Git.

In this automation project, the Python programming language was employed, utilizing Selenium WebDriver, pytest, 
and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to construct a framework.

To run the code, you can clone it using Git from: https://github.com/KevinMarxKvM/Selenium_Webdriver_with_Python_Frameworks.git

The logging class was imported to generate a 'logfile.log' where a real-time report of the code execution is compiled. 
Similarly, you will find an HTML report from the last time the code was run, 
including its results (copy the path of the report.html and paste it into your web browser to view the report).
